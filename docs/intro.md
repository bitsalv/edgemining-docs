# Introduction

Welcome to Edge Mining - a research-driven, open-source project that transforms surplus energy into Bitcoin-powered digital value.

## What is Edge Mining?

Edge Mining is an innovative solution that addresses the challenge of unused energy during low-demand periods. Instead of selling energy cheaply, investing in costly storage, or simply wasting it, Edge Mining converts surplus energy directly into Bitcoin, creating sustainable and intelligent value.

## Our Mission

We believe that energy should never go to waste. Our mission is to unlock new economic possibilities from otherwise wasted resources by leveraging the power of Bitcoin mining to create value from surplus energy.

## Key Principles

- **Sustainability**: Convert waste energy into valuable digital assets
- **Intelligence**: Smart automation based on energy availability
- **Efficiency**: Maximize the value of every kilowatt-hour
- **Open Source**: Transparent, community-driven development
- **Innovation**: Research-driven approach to energy optimization

## Current Status

Edge Mining is currently in an **alpha stage** of development. Our research-driven approach is rapidly evolving, and features, performance, and reliability are continuously improving.
