# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Edge Mining documentation and codebase.

## A

### Aggregate
A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit for data changes. Aggregates have a root entity that maintains consistency boundaries.

### Anti-Corruption Layer
A design pattern that isolates a system from external dependencies by translating between different data models and protocols.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## B

### Block
A collection of transactions in a blockchain that has been cryptographically linked to the previous block.

### Block Reward
The cryptocurrency reward given to miners for successfully mining a new block in the blockchain.

### Bounded Context
A boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. It helps manage complexity by clearly defining what belongs to the domain and what doesn't.

## C

### Command
An object that represents an intention to change the state of the system. Commands are processed by command handlers.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
A pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store, allowing them to be optimized independently.

### Cryptocurrency
A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a decentralized network.

## D

### Domain
A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. In Domain-Driven Design, a domain represents a specific area of business functionality.

### Domain Event
A significant occurrence that happened within the domain. Domain events are used to communicate changes between different parts of the system.

### Domain Model
A conceptual model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data. It represents the core business logic and rules.

### Domain Service
A service that implements domain logic that doesn't naturally belong to any entity or value object.

## E

### Edge Device
A computing device that performs data processing at the edge of a network, closer to the data source, rather than in a centralized location.

### Entity
An object that has a unique identity and a lifecycle that can change over time. Entities are defined by their identity rather than their attributes.

### Event Sourcing
A pattern where all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. The current state can be reconstructed by replaying these events.

## F

### Fork
A situation where a blockchain splits into two separate chains, usually due to a disagreement in the network about which version of the blockchain to follow.

## H

### Hash
A mathematical function that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters. In cryptocurrency mining, hashes are used to secure the blockchain.

### Hash Rate
The speed at which a computer or network can perform hash operations. It's a measure of mining power and is typically expressed in hashes per second (H/s).

## M

### Mining
The process of validating and adding new transactions to a blockchain by solving complex mathematical puzzles.

### Mining Pool
A group of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of successfully mining blocks and earning rewards.

### Mining Task
A specific computational task assigned to miners, typically involving finding a hash that meets certain criteria.

## N

### Node
A computer or device that participates in a blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.

### Nonce
A number used once in cryptographic communications. In mining, it's a value that miners change to try to find a valid hash.

## P

### Peer
Another node in the network with which a node can communicate directly.

### Proof of Work (PoW)
A consensus mechanism that requires participants to perform computational work to validate transactions and create new blocks.

## Q

### Query
An object that represents a request for data from the system. Queries are processed by query handlers and do not change system state.

## R

### Repository
An abstraction that encapsulates the logic required to access data sources. Repositories provide a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

### Reward
The cryptocurrency payment given to miners for successfully mining a block or contributing to the network.

## S

### Service
A stateless object that implements domain logic that doesn't belong to any entity or value object.

### Shared Kernel
A design pattern where multiple bounded contexts share a common subset of the domain model, including code, database schema, and language.

### Smart Contract
A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts run on blockchain platforms.

## T

### Transaction
A record of a cryptocurrency transfer from one address to another. Transactions are grouped together in blocks.

### Transaction Fee
A small amount of cryptocurrency paid to miners for processing and validating a transaction.

## U

### User Story
A description of a feature from the perspective of the end user. User stories help guide development by focusing on user value.

## V

### Value Object
An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity. Value objects are defined by their attributes rather than their identity.

## W

### Wallet
A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. Wallets contain private keys that are used to sign transactions.

### WebSocket
A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data exchange.

## Z

### Zero-Knowledge Proof
A cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.
