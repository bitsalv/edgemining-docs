# About Us

## Our Story

Edge Mining was born from a simple observation: energy often goes unused during low-demand periods. Instead of selling this energy cheaply, investing in costly storage solutions, or simply wasting it, we saw an opportunity to convert surplus energy directly into Bitcoin, creating sustainable and intelligent value.

## Our Mission

We believe that energy should never go to waste. Our mission is to unlock new economic possibilities from otherwise wasted resources by leveraging the power of Bitcoin mining to create value from surplus energy.

## Why We Exist

Energy often goes unused during low-demand periods. Instead of selling cheaply, investing in costly storage, or wasting this energy, Edge Mining converts it directly into Bitcoin, creating value sustainably and intelligently.
