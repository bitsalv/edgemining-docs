# Domain-Driven Architecture Overview

The central problem the application solves is the *optimization of energy usage* using excess energy production (especially from renewables) by integrating Bitcoin mining. This isn't just about mining; it's about using mining as *a tool* for energy management. The core domain revolves around the intelligent automation and control of mining based on energy availability and goals.

# Domains Brake Down

This outlines a strategic categorization of subdomains according to their importance within the system. Furthermore, it details the internal composition of each subdomain, breaking it down into entities, value objects, and aggregates to clarify responsibilities and structure.

- 🟢​ **Core:** The *automation/decision logic* is central. This is where the unique value proposition lies.
- 🟣 **Supporting:** These domains are necessary for the core domain to function but aren't the primary differentiator.
- ⚫ **Generic:** These are common problems solved elsewhere, not specific to this domain.

The identified domains are:
- 🟢 [Energy Optimization & Mining Automation](#energy-optimization--mining-automation)
- 🟣 [Energy System Monitoring](#energy-system-monitoring)
- 🟣 [Mining Device Management](#mining-device-management)
- 🟣 [Home Consumption Analytics](#home-consumption-analytics)
- 🟣 [Heat Utilization](#heat-utilization)
- 🟣 [Mining Performance Analysis](#mining-performance-analysis)
- ⚫ [User Configuration](#user-configuration)
- ⚫ [External Data Integration](#external-data-integration)
- ⚫ [Notification System](#notification-system)

## Energy Optimization & Mining Automation
This is the **Core** domain that captures the intelligence, making smart decisions about *when* to mine based on energy conditions.

**Components**:
  - `OptimizationPolicy` (Entity? Aggregate Root?): A collection of rules and goals driving the automation decisions. It makes decisions based on input (e.g. "*stabilizes hashrate*", "*battery health*" or "*heats the room*").
  - `AutomationRule` (Entity? Maybe Value Object within a Policy?): Represents a user-defined or system rule (e.g., "*turn on if battery > 80% AND forecast > X*"). The *logic* itself.
  - `EnergyStateSnapshot` (Value Object): Represents the state of the energy system at a point in time (*production*, *consumption*, *battery level*, *forecast*). Used as input for decisions.
  - `MiningDecision` (Value Object): The output of the policy (e.g., `StartMining`, `StopMining`, `MaintainState`, `ChangeState`).
  - `ForecastData` (Value Object): Represents the relevant solar/energy forecast.

## Energy System Monitoring
This is a **Supporting** domain, focuses on data acquisition from the energy plant (production, storage, consumption) and to provide them to the core domain. It doesn't *decide* anything, just reports.

**Components**:
  - `EnergyPlant` (Entity or Aggregate Root): Represents the overall energy production system.
  - `EnergySource` (Entity): e.g., Solar Panel Array, Wind Turbine. Has properties like `CurrentProduction` (VO).
  - `EnergyStorage` (Entity): e.g., Battery. Has properties like `StateOfCharge` (VO), `NominalCapacity` (VO), `ActualCapacity` (VO).
  - `EnergyLoad` (Entity): Represents the user's main energy load. Contains `CurrentConsumption` (VO)
  - `EnergyReading` (Value Object): A specific measurement (e.g., 5 kW production at timestamp T).
  - `EnergyStateSnapshot` (Value Object): Represents the state of the energy system at a point in time (*production*, *consumption*, *battery level*, *forecast*). Used as input for decisions.

## Mining Device Management
This is a **Supporting** domain, focuses on controlling and possibly monitoring the state of the ASIC miners. Needs to execute the commands from the core domain (turn on/off) and maybe report miner status. It doesn't *decide* when to turn on/off.

**Components**:
  - `Miner` (ASIC) (Entity): Represents a physical mining device. Has a `MinerId` (VO), `Status` (VO: *On, Off, Error*), maybe `PowerConsumption` (VO).
  - `MiningFarm` (Entity? Aggregate Root? Optional): If managing multiple miners as a group.
  - `ControlCommand` (Value Object): e.g., `TurnOn`, `TurnOff`, `SetHashboard`.

## Home Consumption Analytics
This is a **Supporting** domain, focuses on home energy loads forcasts. Needs to provide data (estimate consumptions, times) of the home energy loads (Washing machine, Dishwasher, Boiler, EV Charger) to the core domain. It can be a **core subdomain** (thanks to [this post](https://vladikk.com/2018/01/26/revisiting-the-basics-of-ddd/)), but let's keep it as supporting for now.

**Components**:
  - `HomeLoadsProfile` (Aggregate Root): Represents the typical energy load profile of a household.
  - `LoadDevice` (Entity): Represents a specific energy load inside the home. Includes `ConsumptionForecast`.

## Heat Utilization
This is a **Supporting** domain, could become more core if heat *demand* starts driving mining decisions, but based on the actual needs, it's primarily about *using* the byproduct.

**Components**:
  - (Potentially) `HeatOutput` (Value Object?): Associated with a Miner's operation.
  - (Potentially) `HeatingZone` (Entity?): If actively managing heat distribution.
  - (Potentially) `TemperatureSensor` (Entity?): To monitor effectiveness.

## Mining Performance Analysis
This is a **Supporting** domain, focuses on reporting earnings, hash rates, etc. Important for the user, but the core *automation* doesn't strictly depend on real-time profitability calculations (though it could influence user *goals*).

**Components**:
  - `MiningSession` (Entity?): Represents a period when a miner was active.
  - `MiningReward` (Value Object): Satoshi earned.
  - `HashRate` (Value Object): Mining speed.
  - `PoolConnectionDetails` (Value Object/Entity?): Details about the mining pool being used.

## User Configuration
This is a **Generic** domain. Handles user settings, goals, and UI presentation. Let's treat it as Supporting as it presents data from other domains and takes user input that influences the Core domain.

**Components**:
  - `User` (Entity): The system user.
  - `SystemSettings` (Entity/VO): Global or specific settings.
  - `NotificationPreference` (VO): Notification settings.

## External Data Integration
Getting data from external services (e.g., Weather/Solar Forecast).

**Components**:
  - `ForecastProvider` (Interface/Adapter): Weather/solar forecast service.
  - (Potentially) `GridDataService` (Interface/Adapter): Grid pricing integration.

## Notification System
This is a **Generic** domain. Informing users about events.

**Components**:
